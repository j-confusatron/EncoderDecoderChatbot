Turn that off!  Get the bags.
Recommendations.
It's stupid.
What is wrong?
Yes.
Huh?
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.
What is it?
You don't have the demographics.
Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.
Like I say, you wanna hook that up... I ain't in ya way. That switch of hers been all over this town. Got that sickness, you know.
Is that what you call it?
Stop it Mike.
Let's talk about Conklin.
Yes.
No autonomic effects... that's correct.
Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!
So I hear you have a girlfriend.
No.
If you don't want me to pose for him, why do you want me to meet him?
What class?
Who're you?
I'd go Special Reconnaissance. Every bit as tough -- and we have a 60 percent drop-out rate among the men.
Because, if the British got off their asses and came up here, now, we would be smashed.  And the revolution would be finished.  Tell King Louis, it's that bad.
I don't know.
Thank you.  Why does he need you by him?
Yes.
I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't -- I am broke!
Look, they're staring right at us.
Did you see him?
I knew you'd come back.
You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.
Sweeney.
Well, yeah... I think that if you knew him... I mean if you'd understand his urges, shit the guy's like forty or something.
How much are you ahead?
That's far enough!
No, I'm not...
I'd like to have a talk with him.
That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.
Hear what?
Can we get through these?
Umm. Altogether?
What do you see?
Could I be anymore goddamn spastic?  So you're sure, this Warner guy is "the one"?
Maybe...?
I mean... tough break.
Well, it must have taken
I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
Oh, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me.
Now I got you for a witness, I'm going to try again. So far all I dragged out of him is he's from Bahston and he's only been in the Army two months.  Where were you when they drafted you?
Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version.
Mother!
I'm going to tell him the truth.
You lie.
Wait here?  So Cheeco can bite my ass off?  Tell me where it is I'll do it.
What is it?
Of course we've tried, but so far we've come up with nothing that ...
I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
You're better than candy.
Rachel not feeling well?
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
For work.....
Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.
How do you know so much about this junk, Plato?
Before you got here, Mr. Orange was askin' me to take him to a hospital. Now I don't like turning him over to the cops, but if we don't, he's dead. He begged me to do it. I told him to hold off till Joe got here.
Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions.
Yes?
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
You see ghosts, Cole?
Who are you trying to please? Yourself?  Her?  Which her, this one or that one.  Can you face both?  We are in a situation that is beyond morality.  So: Leave with her.  You'll see the transformation.
As the duly elected Compound Chief, I protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud.
Begging the Admiral's pardon: General Order 15: 'No  flag officer shall beam into a hazardous area without armed escort.'
Take care of him. He's a very special man.
I am husband?
Uncuff me. What's wrong with you? Don't you want to save the boy?
Yes.  Tell me.
I ride around nights mostly. Subways, buses. See things. Figur'd I might as well get paid for it.
Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm glad you came. Are you hungry?
I can't sleep with the closet door open, either.  Not even a crack.  Your father doesn't mind, though. It could be wide open for all he cared.  I think one of the reasons I divorced him was because he never believed... in the horror... of the <u>closet monster</u>!
Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.
Have you been to  Let's see -- Santiago, Chile?
You go. I'm staying with it.
Didn't this investigation, with its attendant publicity, catapult you into the office you now hold?
So what?
It was my cousin, Dell, done it? His folks used to visit with us summers.
Got a job at old Frank's place. His son runs it now.
Very well. First of all, I'll have them search the waters around the island. I brought two frogmen with me... Meanwhile, we'll take a look up around here.
Not really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?
Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support - moral or otherwise.
'Cause I'm not calling out from the phone company anymore--  --I think the place is bugged.
And this is my future. This is who I am!
What a fucking day!  We only just got a sitter.  I don't know her from fucking Adam.  She could be a serial killer.  I'm going to have to call every ten minutes. You have to let me give out the number.
Someone from the office.
You think?
I know what you are thinking.  I'm not going to disappear, okay?  I'm not going anywhere, just down there, to that beautiful beach.  I got to get out of this room, just for a little while.
You're in the play?
Sixth floor too high for you, Fink?
What?  I'm sorry.  You were saying...
Three times.  Powerful number.
Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but, well, you know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Not in front of the kid.
But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?
Yeah, well, welcome to the club.
How <u>you</u> doing?
Are you nuts, Buffy?  There's a hundred of them out there.  They'll rip us apart.
I'll come by.
Ah, the good guys always triumph in the end. It's what allows our children to sleep at night.
What's Fergus?
Do you know him?
Carl!  Set up the camera.
Any room for me in this Cinema Paradiso?
I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy.
I haven't lost a bill in eighteen years, don't jinx me, Walt.
You're wrong.  Since I met you, I don't dream about holes anymore.
Who's going to catch him?  You?  And if you do, there'll be another one.  And one after that.
There has to be.
He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
Frida's sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know.
Listen Neil, I appreciate your interest in me but I'm not like you.  When you say things, people pay attention.  People follow you.  I'm not like that.
You were worried, Jabez, weren't you?
Is it true that you were hired to track down and capture the thieves... and then deliver them to Drake Bishop... owner of the Stratosphere Hotel & Casino?
Say it not lightly...  Do you know its meaning?
Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please --
They can tap anything as along as it's an airwave intercept. Cellulars and pagers your kid can do.  Hard-line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs. We'd suck in everything. All foreign, most domestic.  Domestic was my group. Druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we wanted.
Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?
When Donna told us about you, and what you told her about the chromium, we figured that might have something to do with this, too.
Is she gonna die?
So ... ?
Please don't make this personal --
That... sawing and hammering.
No...no...we can't...we can't..
LAX. Go to the Pan Am desk. There will be a ticket waiting for you.
What else, John.  It must be different, huh?  Are people living on the moon?
'm not worried about this kid.
Heard of a man called Thorpe?
Gee, Frankie, it's good to see you. Reminds me of old times.
You want to come along quiet?
Tell me what you really think.
It's fine.
What are you doing out here alone?
How are you?
First tell me this similarity is not incredible.
It's a double.
I love you. Keep the children safe.
Hawk, Hawk, Hawk.  Enjoying Italy?  I always had a soft spot for Rome.  Did my first barehanded strangulation here.  Communist politician.
She your only sibling?
That's your problem, George Bailey.
Sharks are man-biters, Mister Hutton.  Not man-eaters --
Well, no you didn't --
What's to be scared about?  It's just a little hiccup in the power.
We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you. He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete -- Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and --
He may be a kook but he's also been all over the world with them.  He even swam in the Grimetti with killer Niles all around him, he never got nipped.
Invitations?
Is it finished?
What do I have to do?
It's just...too late for me to be fuckin' around.  I gotta stop. I gotta clean my brain of all the shit I've done that I shouldn't have done --
THEY WILL FIND OUT ABOUT YOU.  THEY WILL LOCK YOU IN A PLACE WORSE THAN BROTHER BUDDY'S.
You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you?
No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.
What lawyer?
Simple game.  Four players.  Exfil opens the pocket --  -- cyber ops lifts the wallet.
Oh!
What's wrong ?
I will I promise.
I could go for a Coke.
What'd you feel when you kissed him?
Have we got something for you. Something which will make you love me so much you'll want to hug me every single day for the rest of my life.
We're saved!
Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?
What would that be, sir?
And pointless.
I need a receipt.  Sign your name across the flap.
We just did.
Stay here.
I wish you wouldn't pick on Rose and tease her like that. Of course her clothes are silly, but she's ignorant, naive, she doesn't know any better.
...That boy damn near broke my arm.
I don't have it with me...
Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?
Is that what she used to sing?
Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee, he was going to be a preacher, his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch Hudson.
Can I come with her?
It's very simple.  You worked a nice, quiet town, but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it.  I've just never seen it done that way before, Detective.
No, sir.
Okay.
It's after five.  We have to bathe.
I'm glad of it you was borned.  I reckon I ain't gonna be there in the garage no more.
Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?
It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.
But how are you going to escape?
Beth -- gimme the gun.
Go you Huskies?
Napalm.
What's the target.
Ahh!  Baby's got two heads!!!
Yes, mustn't stop.
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
You bet.
Me?  No.  What are you doing here?
We've met.  The Hacksaw Murders.  '89.
The doctor Harry used to go to. He was passing just after it happened.
Ten thousand.
Vous êtes Français?
What's in here then, lead?
You worked here?
Yes, Baron.
You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
The Sick Boy method.
No no no no no no no no no...
If the key's on him, to get the key we'd have to . . .
He's just laying in bed. He's pretty upset. He won't talk.
Hold on a second.
What do you think you are doing?
Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?
Listen, you clowns, there's somebody else out there trying to buy your airline, if you want to be Pac-manned and gobbled by Atilla the Hun be my guest!
I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...
It was in your book.
Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
Why are you talking like that?
